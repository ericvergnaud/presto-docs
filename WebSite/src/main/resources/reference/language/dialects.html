        <h2>Prompto dialects</h2>

        <p>Information technologists can have very different backgrounds.<br/>
            Some are very technical, with strong skills in OOP languages such as Java or C#.<br/>
            Some have grown their programming skills from scripting languages such as Python.<br/>
            Others have little or no coding experience, and work more on functional specifications, project
            management or testing.<br/>
            All these information technologists participate actively in the development.<br/>
            At Prompto, we believe they are all developers, and should have equal access to code.
        </p>

        <h2>Syntax is a detail</h2>

        <p>To facilitate the conversation between all breeds of developers, Prompto comes with not one "language" but
            three.<br/>
            Prompto calls these dialects, as they are not independant languages, but rather 3 syntactic variations of the same language concepts.<br/>
            Prompto dialects are a collaborative tool which helps technologists work together.<br/>
            They eliminate the barrier of having to learn a formal grammar only to read code.<br/>
            They make it very easy for any developer to adopt the Prompto platform, whatever his/her coding
            background.
        </p>

        <h2>The Objy dialect aka "O"</h2>

        <p>Objy uses a syntax that tries to follow as much as possible the syntax of OOP languages such as C++, Java
            or C#.<br/>
            Since Prompto introduces new concepts, the Objy syntax sometimes differs from these languages.<br/>
            But structuring elements are very similar: semi-colons to end statements, curly braces to group multiple
            statements, etc...<br/>
            Here is an example:<br/>
        <pre><code>method main ( ) {
    print("15 + 3.5");
    print("= 28.5");
}</code></pre>
        </p>
        <h2>The Monty dialect aka "M"</h2>

        <p>Monty uses a syntax that tries to follow as much as possible the syntax of the Python 3 language.<br/>
            Since Prompto introduces new concepts, the Monty syntax sometimes differs from the Python 3 syntax.<br/>
            But structuring elements are very similar: one statement per line, colon and indentation to group multiple
            statements, etc...<br/>
            Here is an example:<br/>
        <pre><code>def main(options:Text<:>):
    print("15 + 3.5")
    print("= 28.5")</code></pre>
        </p>
        <h2>The Engly dialect aka "E"</h2>

        <p>Engly is a syntax that mimics English as much as possible.<br/>
            The intent is that developers with little or no coding background should be able to read code without having to learn the formalism of other dialects.<br/>
            The structure is very similar to Monty. Additionaly, it removes parenthesis, and many keywords are replaced by plain English words.<br/>
            Here is an example:<br/>
        <pre><code>define main as method doing:
    print "15 + 3.5"
    print "= 28.5"</code></pre>
        </p>
        <h2>Seamless translation between dialects</h2>

        <p>Prompto tools provide seamless translation from one dialect to another.<br/>
            Practically, you simply need to select the dialect of your choice.<br/>
            This makes it very easy for any developer to view any code in his/her preferred dialect.<br/>
            It also makes it very easy for a developer to switch dialect in the future, since no rewriting is needed.<br/>
            You can experience this translation by exploring the examples in this documentation.
