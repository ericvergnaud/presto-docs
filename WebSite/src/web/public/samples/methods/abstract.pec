define printShape as abstract method receiving Shape shape

define printShape as method receiving Square shape doing:
    printLine "Square side is " + (shape.perimeter / 4)

define printShape as method receiving Circle shape doing:
    printLine "Circle radius is " + (shape.perimeter / (2 * 3.14159))

define main as method doing:
    s = Square with 40.0 as perimeter
    c = Circle with 40.0 as perimeter
    shapes = [ s as Shape, c as Shape ]
    for each ss in shapes:
        printShape with ss as shape
