            <h2>React widget state</h2>
            <p>React supports both stateless and controlled components. Controlled components have a state, which is used to control the component.<br/>
                To set and access state, React widgets come with 4 methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>getInitialState</b><br/>
                    The getInitialState is an optional callback that is called by React to set a controlled component's initial state. It must return a Document.<br/>
                    <br/>
                </li>

                <li><b>getState</b><br/>
                    This method returns the current state of the controlled component, in the form of a Document.<br/>
                    Alternately, you can use the built-in <code><i>state</i></code> widget field.<br/>
                    <br/>
                </li>

                <li><b>setState</b><br/>
                    This method sets the new state of the controlled component, in the form of a Document.<br/>
                    (continuation is not supported yet, but is coming soon).<br/>
                    <br/>
                </li>

                <li><b>getDerivedStateFromProps</b><br/>
                    This method is rarely used, see <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#static-getderivedstatefromprops" rel="noreferrer noopener">getDerivedStateFromProps</a>.<br/>
                     <br/>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is an example where the 3 common methods are used.</p>
