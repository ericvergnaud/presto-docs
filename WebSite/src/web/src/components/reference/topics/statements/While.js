            <h2>While statement</h2>

            <p>A while statement is a way to execute a set of statements while a condition is met.<br/>
                A while statement has the form <code>while <i>condition</i></code>
                followed by a list of statements which will be executed repeatedly,
                where <code><i>condition</i></code> is a boolean expression.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <h3>
                    Breaking the iteration
                </h3>

                <p>It is sometimes useful to break the iteration before testing the condition again. This is achieved
                    using the <code>break</code> statement.</p>
            <PromptoPlayer key={PromptoPlayer.nextKey()} lines={12} sampleUrl="samples/statements/while-break.pec" runnable={true}/>
                <br/>

                <p>The difference between a while and a do while statements is that the embedded statements in a while
                    statement may never get executed,
                    whilst they are executed at least once with a do while statement</p>
            </>;
