                <h2><i>Abstract</i> methods</h2>
                <p>Prompto supports <code><i>abstract</i></code> methods, a special type of method, which <i>must</i> be overloaded.</p>
                <p>Abstract methods are resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the value.</p>
                <p>Abstract methods are well suited when no actual behaviour can be determined for an argument type (such as in the below <i>Shape</i>).</p>
                <p>In the below example, we do not know how to print a shape, only how to print specific shape types.</p>
                <p>In order to print a list of shapes without knowing their type, we use an abstract method.</p>
                <PromptoPlayer key={PromptoPlayer.nextKey()} lines={20} sampleUrl="samples/methods/abstract.pec" runnable={true}/>
                <p/>

                <h3><i>Abstract</i> methods as arguments</h3>
                <p>Abstract methods can also be used as arguments for other methods:</p>
                <PromptoPlayer key={PromptoPlayer.nextKey()} lines={12} sampleUrl="samples/methods/abstractArgument.pec" runnable={true}/>
                <p>In the above example, we show how to pass both a value: <i>Hello</i> and a method: <code><i>displayScreen</i></code> to another method: <code><i>someMethod</i></code>.</p>
                <p>The method: <code><i>someMethod</i></code> then invokes the method received as an argument, using the value also received as an argument.</p>
                <p>The method caller is responsible for providing a non abstract method compatible with the argument's method type.</p>
                <p>Please note that in the E dialect only, the <code>Method:</code> keyword is required to let Prompto decide whether to pass <code><i>displayScreen</i></code>
                        directly as an argument, or to invoke it and pass the result. This is not required in O and M dialects, where method invocation requires parenthesis.</p>
            </>;
